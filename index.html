Week 2: 9/14</h3>

<p>We began learning HTML and CSS. We also researched wash apps used in other colleges (ex. Stony Brook) and looked into Uber’s methods.</p>


<h3>

Week 3: 9/21</h3>

<p>We continued learning HTML and CSS and began learning how to use the Bootstrap framework.</p>



<h3>

Week 4: 9/28</h3>

<p>We continued learning HTML, CSS, and the Bootstrap framework. We chose a Bootstrap template to work with.
</p>
<h3>
Week 5</h3>

<p>We continued learning how to use the Bootstrap framework. We edited the website, adding in a homepage that describes the purpose of VUWash and how it works, a “create washer account” page, a “laundry form” page, and a contact page. We brainstormed how we wanted the forms to look. One form would be for creating a washer account, the other for sending out laundry requests to these washers, and the last for contacting us. We began learning JavaScript, PHP and mySQL.
</p>

<h3>Week 6: 10/12</h3>

<p>While attending a conference in Houston, Texas we continued learning JavaScript, PHP and mySQL.
</p>

<h3>Week 7: 10/19</h3>

<p>We focused on learning PHP and mySQL. We signed up for Paypal Business account so that we would be able to incorporate payment 
into our laundry request forms. We created the three forms in HTML without the functionality.
</p>

<h3>Week 8 10/26</h3>

<p>This week we focused on getting the contact us form to work. Using our newly acquired skills 
in PHP we were able to do so! While this was happening, we created a PayPal button using HTML.
</p>

<h3>Week 9: 11/2</h3>

<p>Now that we got the Contact us form working, we had to get the laundry request form and the sign up form for the washers to work.
In order to do this we created two databases: One for storing information about the washers and the users, and another for storing transactions.
We set up the forms to submit entries to the databases upon submission and linked our Paypal button to the laundry request form.
</p>

<h3>Week 10: 11/9</h3>

<p>We tested the forms and tweaked our ideas of how we wanted the requests to be sent out upon submission.
We decided the best method would be to have emails sent to washers who had set their preferences to the
same building indicated on the laundry request form.
</p>

<h3>Week 11: 11/16</h3>
<p>
  Though we had the forms working and connected to the database, we needed them to redirect the user after 
  they submitted the forms, to make the website more fliud. This was also about the point that we realized
  because the PayPal button takes the user away from teh website, we needed to store the order information
  in our transaction table before redirecting. So this is what we were able to figure out this week
</p>


<h3>Week 12: 11/23</h3>

<p>
  We finished up the last part of the laundry form’s function so that it now sends out an email to
  washers set to the same building indicated on the form.
</p>

<h3>Week 13: 11/30</h3>

<p>This Week: Quality Assurance! We re-tested all the payment and application features and did a final
review of the sign up.
